## Abstract
<!-- Context      -->
The tooling around the Solid protocol for realizing personal data vaults is mainly focused on Web-based applications.
<!-- Need         -->
Nevertheless, system administrators may prefer command-line workflows 
for resource management and exchange, for which tooling is currently lacking.
<!-- Task         -->
We developed a command-line tool called Bashlib as a 
wrapper around common command-line utilities that integrates
Solid authentication and authorization functionality.
<!-- Object       -->
Support is provided for multiple authentication flows 
and switching authenticated sessions. Management for resource 
sharing has been integrated supporting both authorization standards 
in WAC and ACP, as well as utilities for resource management
and the evaluation of SPARQL queries over the document structure.
<!-- Findings     -->
<!-- ## No findings ## -->
<!-- Conclusion   -->
This way, Bashlib opens up adoption pathways for existing data flows to
expand data sharing in the Solid ecosystem.
