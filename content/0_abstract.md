## Abstract
<!-- Context      -->
Integration of the Solid protocol is restrictive to 
Web-based applications in much of its tooling support.
<!-- Need         -->
Where existing professional and consumer workflows make heavy use
of command-line utilities to manage and exchange data as resources, 
driving Solid integration in this ecosystem lacks tooling support.
<!-- Task         -->
For this, we developed Bashlib as a wrapper around
often used command-line utilities while providing support
for Solid authentication and authorization functionality.
<!-- Object       -->
Through support for multiple authentication flows and
switching sessions on the fly, support for the two
authorization standards, resource management utilities
and solid specific functionality such as querying, 
Bashlib provides a well-rounded basis for integrating
existing workflows with Solid through minimal effort.
<!-- Findings     -->
<!-- ## No findings ## -->
<!-- Conclusion   -->
By providing command-line integration with the Solid ecosystem,
Bashlib opens up adoption pathways for existing data flows to
expand data sharing in decentralized ecosystems.
