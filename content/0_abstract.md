## Abstract
<!-- Context      -->
The tooling around the Solid protocol for realizing personal data vaults is mainly focused on Web-based applications.
<!-- Need         -->
Nevertheless, system administrators may prefer command-line workflows to manage and exchange data in such a vault, for which tooling currently is lacking.
<!-- Task         -->
We developed a command-line tool called Bashlib as a wrapper around
common command-line commands, while adding support
for Solid authentication and authorization functionality.
<!-- Object       -->
It supports multiple authentication flows, supports
switching sessions, supports the two
authorization standards WAC and ACP, has resource management utilities
and offers solid specific functionality such as querying.
<!-- Findings     -->
<!-- ## No findings ## -->
<!-- Conclusion   -->
This way, Bashlib opens up adoption pathways for existing data flows to
expand data sharing in the Solid ecosystem.
