<!-- * Bashlib provides the necessary functionality to integrate Solid in CLI workflows. -->
<!-- * Bashlib can perform automated background tasks for multiple profiles. -->

BashLib provides the required functionality to integrate (existing) CLI workflows into the Solid ecosystem, 
providing a simple interface for authentication, authorization, and data management. 
Supporting both the spec-complient interactive authentication flow and 
the implementation-specific background authentication flows, 
in combination with management of multiple authentiated sessions,
Bashlib can be used to integrate any combination of professional 
and personal workflows interchangeably.

By bridging the gap between the Solid ecosystem and CLI-based automation, 
BashLib lowers the entry barrier for developers and system administrators
to integrate Solid in new and existing workflows.
