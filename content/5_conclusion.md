<!-- * Bashlib provides the necessary functionality to integrate Solid in CLI workflows. -->
<!-- * Bashlib can perform automated background tasks for multiple profiles. -->

In this paper we introduced BashLib, which provides a base set of utilities to help integrating command-line
workflows in the Solid ecosystem.
It provides a simple interface for authentication 
and authorization management and mapping commonly used utilities for data management. 
Supporting both the specification compliant authentication flow and
the Solid-server specific authentication-token based flow, 
Bashlib aims to be both future-proof and provide support for automated background workflows.
Similarly the support for both authorization systems aims to allow integration throughout
the full Solid ecosystem.
This way, BashLib lowers the barrier for developers and systems administrators
to integrate both new and existing workflows into the Solid ecosystem.
