      <!-- Context      -->
      <p>Integration of the Solid protocol is restrictive to 
Web-based applications in much of its tooling support.
<!-- Need         -->
Where existing professional and consumer workflows make heavy use
of command line utilities to manage and exchange data as resources, 
driving Solid integration in this ecosystem lacks tooling support.
<!-- Task         -->
For this, we developed Bashlib as a wrapper around
often used command line utilities while providing support
for Solid authentication and authorization functionality.
<!-- Object       -->
Through support for multiple authentication flows and
switching sessions on the fly, support for the two
authorization standards, resource management utilities
and solid specific functionality such as querying, 
Bashlib provides a well-rounded basis for integrating
existing workflows with Solid through minimal effort.
<!-- Findings     -->
<!-- ## No findings ## -->
<!-- Conclusion   -->
By providing command line integration with the Solid ecosystem,
Bashlib opens up adoption pathways for existing data flows to
expand data sharing in decentralized ecosystems.

        <!-- * Integrating Solid in workflows requires intensive knowledge of libraries and programming languages. -->
        <!-- * Where BASH allows for straightforward integration in existing workflows, Solid has little tooling to support this. -->
        <!-- * We present BashLib as a Solid authentication wrapper for common BASH functionality and Solid-specific additions -->
        <!-- * Goal to enable CLI flows to integrate Solid in their workflow -->

        <p>The <a property="schema:citation http://purl.org/spar/cito/cites" href="https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Solid-%3A-A-Platform-for-Decentralized-Social-Based-Sambra-Mansour/5ac93548fd0628f7ff8ff65b5878d04c79c513c4">Solid Protocol</a> <span class="references">[<a href="#ref-1">1</a>]</span> introduced a framework 
for decentralized data storage and sharing, 
empowering users with control over their data in an interoperable web environment.
However, driving integration for Solid into existing workflows remains challenging, 
as its adoption is mainly focused integration in Web applications.
In contrast, many professional and personal workflows are built on exchanging 
data as documents via the command line, which could benefit from the Solid ecosystem
approach to data sharing and integration. However, with Solid integration lacking
the necessary tooling in the command line ecosystem, this remains challenging.</p>

        <p>To address this lack of tooling, we introduce BashLib as a command line utility to
integrate Solid authentication and data sharing functionality into the command line ecosystem. 
Bashlib integrates Solid functionality for authentication, authorization and resource management.
This enables the integration of existing flows of data with the Solid ecosystem by 
providing integrations for resource sharing, querying and integration fpr the Solid ecosystem.</p>

        <p>By bridging the gap between Solid and the command line, 
BashLib aims to facilitate broader adoption of Solid principles in automated workflows, 
widening the target audience of the Solid ecosystem 
and providing new capabilities for command-line based decentralized data management.</p>

        <p>To set the example, we take the case of a researcher that is making a presentation
for an upcoming conference. We will look at how Bashlib supports the flow of 
a researcher named Ben, who wants to integrate their workflow of getting feedback
from colleagues on a presentation in development and publishing the resulting 
presentation, using their Solid pod.</p>

  <section id="authentication" inlist="" rel="schema:hasPart" resource="#authentication">
<div datatype="rdf:HTML" property="schema:description">
        <h2 property="schema:name">Authentication</h2>

        <!-- * Solid authentication is the core on which its privacy systems are built. -->
        <!-- * Bashlib supports interactive browser login flows -->
        <!-- * Bashlib supports hot-swapping authentication sessions on the fly to quickly swap between professional and personal identities. -->
        <!-- * As interactive authentication flows are essential for back-end tasks, we support the latest client credentials implementations from both the CSS and ESS implementations. -->

        <p>Authentication is a fundamental component of the Solid protocol, serving as the foundation for its privacy mechanisms.
The Solid access control systems that allow users to manage their Solid pods and share data with actors in the network
is based on the identity of the user and the actors with whom data is being shared. 
To design capabilities for Solid authentication management on the CLI needs to take into account the following requirements:</p>

        <p>(i) Bashlib supports the OpenID Connect defined in the Solid specification <a href="">todo: cite? or footnote</a>
to authenticate users through an interactive browser logion flow. 
This opens up an identical interface as when authenticating a Solid session 
using Web applications. Where this flow is compatible with all Solid Server 
implementations, the interactive nature of the authentication flow makes 
it jarring for most CLI integrations.</p>

        <p>(ii) Building authentication systems for multiple identities is a core requirement for many workflows. 
Bashlib internally caches any authenticated sessions, 
making it possible to quickly swap between sessions in workflows.
This feature is particularly useful for professionals managing both personal 
and enterprise-level Solid interactions, allowing for smooth transitions between identities.</p>

        <p>(iii) Where Bashlib supports the interactive OpenID Connect login flow in the browser,
this is not usable for automated systems that need to synchronize, manage and exchange 
data via the Solid protocol. For this reason, both the Community Solid Server <span class="references">[<a href="#ref-2">2</a>]</span><sup id="fnref:CSS"><a href="#fn:CSS" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>
and the <a href="">Enterprise Solid Server</a><sup id="fnref:ESS"><a href="#fn:ESS" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> implementations of the Solid Server provide support for a Client Credentials flow,
that enable authenticated sessions to be dynamically setup in the background without user interaction.
By integrating these credential-based authentication methods, 
BashLib enables backend services to securely access Solid resources without manual intervention, 
expanding the potential for Solid adoption in automated and infrastructure-level applications.</p>

        <p>Going back to the example, our researcher Ben is hosting their own Solid pod 
on a Community Solid Server instance<span class="references">[<a href="#ref-2">2</a>]</span>.
To setup bashlib to work without needing user interaction, Ben sets up
a credential flow for Bashlib to enable the automated creation of 
authenticated sessions where needed. For this, Ben executes the code
in <a href="#authentication-listing">Listing 1</a> and provides their email and password
information via the interactive command line form.</p>

        <figure id="authentication-listing" class="listing">

            <p><span class="label">Listing 1:</span> The researcher creates a credential token to setup automated authentication for their workflows. Email and password info is provided in the interactive cli form.</p>

  <section id="authorization" inlist="" rel="schema:hasPart" resource="#authorization">
<div datatype="rdf:HTML" property="schema:description">
        <h2 property="schema:name">Authorization</h2>

        <!-- * As Solid supports two authorization specifications, we support the management using both specifications, using the INRUPT AUthentication libraries. -->
        <!-- * The AC mechanism is discovered on the fly -->
        <!-- * For managing Access Control Resources, we do not support the full suite of functionality yet, only the Universal API by INRUPT tooling. -->

        <p>The Solid authorization mechanism determines how access to data is granted and managed, 
ensuring that users and applications interact with resources according to predefined permissions. 
Solid currently supports two distinct authorization specifications: 
The <a href="todo: cite / footnote">Access Control Lists (ACLs)</a> specification and 
the <a href="todo: cite / footnote">Access Control Policies (ACP)</a> specification. 
The coexistence of these two specification in the Solid ecosystem adds complexity
to streamline permission management for Solid workflows, 
requiring seamless support for both authorization mechanisms.</p>

        <p>To address this, BashLib integrates support for both authorization specifications, 
based on automated discovery of the used mechanism and adapting the used permission API
on the fly.
However, as the ACP specification diverges far from the WAC specification, 
permission management is restricted to the resource level when automating 
discovery of the authorization method used by the Solid Server interacted with.
When prior knowledge of the use of WAC is known, recursive permission management
can be enabled.</p>

        <!-- Should we mention Inrupt here? -->
        <!-- leveraging the [Inrupt authentication library](todo: footnote) to implement permission management, -->
        <!-- 

For modifying access permissions, BashLib currently supports the Universal API provided by Inrupt’s tooling. While this does not yet encompass the full range of functionality available for managing Access Control Resources (ACRs), it provides a streamlined way to handle common authorization tasks. This allows users to interact with Solid’s access control models without needing to manually configure complex permission structures. -->

        <p>By simplifying authorization management fpr command-line workflows requiring data sharing, 
and the ability to integrate these systems into command line flows such as cron jobs <a href="todo: footnote / cite?"></a>, 
BashLib lowers the integration barrier for automated data sharing in the Solid ecosystem.</p>

        <p>For our example, Ben has two authorization requirements.
The work in progress version of the publication needs to be
shared with his colleagues Pieter and Ruben, where the 
final version can be published to be publicly readable.
First, Ben creates a public Solid container, in which the 
resulting publication will be published, as shown in <a href="#public-auth-listing">Listing 2</a>.
Next, Ben creates a private Solid container, that is only
shared with his colleagues to store in-progress work
as shown in <a href="#private-auth-listing">Listing 3</a>.</p>

        <figure id="public-auth-listing" class="listing">

        <h2 property="schema:name">Tooling Suite</h2>

        <p>The main part of the functionality provided by Bashlib is aimed at data management.
This functionality is aimed at align commonly used command-line utilities to the
Solid <a href="todo: cite">Linked Data Platform</a> specification used for data management
in an authenticated session.</p>

        <!-- Basic Shell Utilities -->
        <p>A large section of the provided Bashlib functionality aligns with core shell utilities,
making use of the authenticated session to authenticate the user in outgoing requests.
The <code>curl</code> mimics its namesake’s functionality with added outgoing Authentication headers.
The <code>ls</code> utility provides directory listings of the target Solid container.
The <code>tree</code> utility provides a recursive tree listing starting from the targeted Solid container.
The <code>cp</code> and <code>mv</code> utilities provide functionality to move and copy resources between both the 
local file system and Solid pods, automatically recognizing the source and target destinations
as being local or URIs and managing the transfer of resources accordingly.
The <code>touch</code>, <code>mkdir</code> and <code>rm</code> utilities provide functionality to create and remove resources and
containers on a Solid pod.
Finally, the <code>find</code> utility enables the searching of resources on a Solid pod based on their resource
URI.</p>

        <p>Additionally, some Solid specific utility functions have been added.
The <code>query</code> utility executes a SPARQL query either over the individual resources
or the federated set of resources in the target Solid container.
The <code>edit</code> utility is used to load an external resource in a local editor,
and update the resulting resource when saved.</p>

        <p>Providing the above set of CLI utilities,
Bashlib provides a base set of functionality 
that is required to integrate existing 
command line workflows into the Solid ecosystem.</p>

        <p>In our running example, having created the Solid containers
for in-progress work <a href="#private-auth-listing">Listing 3</a> 
and public presentations <a href="#public-auth-listing">Listing 2</a>,
Ben now sets up the scripts to sync his work to
the in-progress container <a href="#private-publishing">Listing 4</a>
that will be visible for Pieter and Ruben to read
for feedback, and the sync script for the finihsed 
presentation in <a href="#public-publishing">Listing 5</a>
that makes the result public.</p>

        <!-- * Bashlib provides the necessary functionality to integrate Solid in CLI workflows. -->
        <!-- * Bashlib can perform automated background tasks for multiple profiles. -->

        <p>BashLib provides the required functionality to integrate (existing) CLI workflows into the Solid ecosystem, 
providing a simple interface for authentication, authorization, and data management. 
Supporting both the spec-complient interactive authentication flow and 
the implementation-specific background authentication flows, 
in combination with management of multiple authentiated sessions,
Bashlib can be used to integrate any combination of professional 
and personal workflows interchangeably.</p>

        <p>By bridging the gap between the Solid ecosystem and CLI-based automation, 
BashLib lowers the entry barrier for developers and system administrators
to integrate Solid in new and existing workflows.</p>
